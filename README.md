Stellar is a web framework that makes it easy to build modular APIs. It is designed to follow an action based pattern that makes it possible to isolate logic in small structures.

- Extremely modular
- Lean and extensible core
- Command line tool to workflow optimization
- Native support for HTTP, WebSocket and TCP connections

Note that Stellar only supports Node.js version 6.
